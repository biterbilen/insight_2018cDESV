Insight Data Science 2018C.DE.SV Term Project 

# Problem:
Finding the relevant data for any interest area topic of interest is hard due to the need for a trusted centralized authority 

# Solution:
Blockchain is a cutting edge technology which eliminates this need and enables the secure peer-to-peer sharing of transactions.

# Pipeline: S3 -> [Hyperledger|Hyperedger Fabric] -> [Redis|Redis+Cassandra] -> SparkMLlib -> Flask

# Challenge: Linking decentralized networks to big data analytics is a novel concept and there should be challenges in its construction, such as the scaling up the system.
Selection of business domain, and data?

# Use cases: Patient data, drug data analytics
